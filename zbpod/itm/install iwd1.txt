//Install order for IWDEE


//I recommend reading this in an advanced text reader/editor like Notepad++ with Java or similar assigned as a language, so you can differentiate lines through color.
//This is an install order in a format ready for Project Infinity. Think of it as a lite, crappier, harder to read version of the Big World Project PDF guide. You can find Project Infinity here: https://github.com/ALIENQuake/ProjectInfinity
//Common sites to find mods are Gibberlings3, Spellhold Studios, and Pocket Plane Group; Couronne de Cuivre and Kerzenburg are French and German sites that also have good content easily available to English speaking audiences. Lava's Weaselmods and Artemius' Artisan's Corner are personal sites that also hold plenty of high quality content. Most sites will also have a Github repository. With some patience, one can also trawl through the Beamdog forums for mods.
//This is no substitute for properly reading mod documentations. It is expected the user has a basic understanding of IE modding and do their work to find the mods, and PI already offers a download function for the most important groups' Githubs.

//Commented lines like these ones starting with // indicate mod components that won't be installed, due to conflicts, subjective choices, problems etc, as well as reasons why some choices were made, and known problems. Any commented line you copy into the install text box of PI will be ignored.
//It doesn't mean you *have* to install everything that's uncommented. That's in fact not recommended. Pick and choose with moderation. Most quest and NPC mods can coexist, but can bloat the game content and step on each other if using the same areas or characters. Mechanical tweaks tend to overlap or clash.
//It's up to the user to check for incompatibilities. For the most part, everything should be in a compatible order (besides noted exceptions), and every uncommented componenent should be compatible among themselves (besides noted warnings for minor clashes), but it's impossible for one person to be sure. You can also download an incomplete, unreleased project from a github repository, but that doesn't mean you should: expect problems if you do.
//As a rule of thumb, if two mods seem to touch even of different aspects of the same element, choose only one. (ie: don't install Deities of Faerun and Faith & Powers together). My selections try to avoid this, and when it seems I fail to do so, it might be experimentation or misplaced bravery. Remember: the smaller your installation, the happier you'll be. And if I note the possibility of changing code, assume you're not that skilled, and skip it or the incompatible mod.
//If you come to me to complain "lolz ur list succs i installd everything and mah computer exploded" I will HAUNT you, I will send my legal team of Gengars to make your life a living hell and I will LICK YOUR EARS WHEN YOU AREN'T LOOKING.

//Modders you may want to avoid are Temnix (total disregard for anything you've installed previously and mod community standards) and Roxxanne (that EE Mod Messup tool is a trap to forcefeed you her crappy narratively & sexually abusive self-insert).
//I also avoid LLM (your ill marketed "AI") related components in my install orders. No disrespect to mod authors who felt they needed to use them, and you can do whatever you want. But I'm personally reticent to their use.
//Avoid mixing mods based on DavidW's SFO library (ie: Sword Coast Stratagems, Talents of Faerun, Angel's Made in Heaven series) and those using OlvynChuru's ClassSpellTool (ie: Olvyn's Spells, Artisan's Shadow Magic and Warlock, B_Spells) until new notice. While technically they're supposed to be compatible as long as the SFO group is installed after the ClassSpellTool group, the compatibility functionality is young yet and may get blindsided by unexpected problems. They're not by themselves bad mods, they're just to be considered incompatible for the time being; stick with one group or the other.

//The SPLSTATE.IDS file has a limit of 256 entries, starting with a default of 133. When installing mods adding new entries, install errors may occur when going above the limit. Any components that I'm aware of adding new states will be noted along with how many entries, so you can take it into account.
//The biggest additions are SCS and ToF with 40~ new states each, followed by EE Fixpack and Enhanced Powergaming Scripts with 20~.

//Mods compatible with both the original and the Enhanced Editions of the games use a tool named "iconv" for text character encoding conversion. If a mod ever gives on install the error: "iconv could not be found", go to the language folder (sometimes named instead as tra, trad, lang, langs, etc) of any other mod (ie: Tweaks Anthology), and copy theirs for the faulty mod. And notify the mod author, please.


//>>On shapeshift mods: there are several mods that modify "shapeshifting". Sadly, that term is used broadly for similar but different things, so care must be taken to avoid harmful mixes.

//JTweaks' Shapeshift corrections only fixes vanilla mage and/or druid forms; you can choose to install it for druids, mages or both, but avoid mixing with similar mods.

//+Mage shapeshifting: the spells Polymorph and Shapechange.
//-IWDification's Expanded Polymorph Self. Three extra forms to Polymorph spell.
//-ToF/SCS' Changes to shapeshift spells ("Install all spell tweaks" includes it) removes and adds forms for thematic effect and avoiding overlap with druids, and retouches those forms left.

//+Druid: normal druid shapeshifting. Similar ideas, slightly different outcomes, all incompatible
//-IWDification's Druid: Use IWD Shapeshifting and Ability Progression. This sets BG2 druids to use the forms the way IWD druids do, with earlier poison immunity, and exchanging elemental resistances for fatigue immunity.
//-ToF's Revised shapeshift powers for druids and avengers. Similar to IWD, faster progression, basic forms (ie: wolf) are upgraded later, game depending (ie: dire/winter wolf), Avengers gain forms faster and a few monstrous extra more. Elemental forms are learned at lv12 and upgraded at 15
//-House Tweaks' Expanded Shapeshifting. Druid get all forms from the start and each has extra skills, avengers get three extra forms. Elemental forms HLAs are removed, they're learned at lv14 and upgrade at lv15.
//-SCS's Improved shapeshifting. Forms are "equipped" by way of "paw" weapons. Forms are all the same. Mostly a convenience change.

//+Shapeshift: the particular druid kit, which has a werewolf form instead of normal animal forms.
//-Artisan's Kitpack's Shapeshifter Overhaul. Whole overhaul of the kit. Human form improves almost every lv from 8 to 15 and fets thief skill (detect traps/illusions, stealth). Starts with wolf form, gets werewolf form at lv 4 which improves every lv until 15. Buffing howl at lv6, improves every 2 lvs until 16. HLAs include: share werewolf form with a non-shapeshifter party member; cumulative bonus when 2 or more party members are in werewolf form; and 1 choice per day of element for immunity and extra melee damage.
//-ToF's Rebalanced and Revised Kits. Shapeshifter's werewolf forms are upgraded at lvs 7 & 19. Old forms are removed. Compatibility with AK's overhaul either by disabling it in dw_talents.ini or installing the "Skip shapeshifters" option instead of "Default".


//>>On weapon proficiency/styles mods: mixing proficiency mods is not easy to do and I do not recommend it for a novice. Pick one style revision and one proficiency revision, and stick with them. There will be THREE placements for these mods. Pre ToF, Post ToF, and Post SCS.
//Pre ToF: This is where you want to install proficiency mods for compatibility with a ToF focused install.
//Post ToF: This is were you want to install proficiency mods in most cases, or when you're not using ToF components that need these changes to happen before. Most comments about compatibility or issues will be stated here. *This would be the case assumed for these install orders.*
//Post SCS: This is mostly when you want to use Skills & Abilities' proficiency overhaul. If that's the case, it is not recommended to use ToF or any of the other proficiency mods.

//As a reference of what each one does (only the most relevant components are mentioned here):

//+Tweaks Anthology
//-Universal Clubs: allows everyone to use clubs.
//-Weapon Styles for All: allows everyone to train in all weapon styles.
//-Alter weapon proficiency system: a simplification of the weapon proficiencies. Different options.

//+House Rules
//-Rebalanced Proficiencies: allows different classes the use of some weapons and styles.
//-Rebalanced Weapon Styles: Training in styles increases from 2 to 5 points, to the benefit of fighters and selected kits.

//+3.5 Edition Weapon Style Rebalance
//Styles receive bonuses emulating certain 3.5e feats and character builds.

//+Shohy's Weapon Style Rebalance
//Rebalance for Weapon Styles: all styles and proficiencies can proc active effects, dependant on weapon type and size.

//+SubtleD's Combat Skills & Proficiencies
//Holistic overhaul of everything proficiency, style, point progression, weapon groups... Not to be mixed with the others.

//+Talents of Faerun
//-Revised Weapon Proficiency System: All characters begin proficient in their allowed weapon types and can specialize on them, all weapons usable by everyone, racial proficiencies, bonus proficiency for ToF's cleric kits, slower prof point progression.
//-Revised Weapon Styles: improved style bonuses.

//+Skills & Abilities
//Reduction of weapon groups, and new non-weapon proficiencies tied to defense or magic, optional faster progression, new or reworked skills. Asks to be installed after SCS. Proficiency overhaul not compatible with the others

// https://github.com/Bubb13/IE-Snippets/tree/master/bubb_revert_pathfinding
//Beamdog, for the v2.5 of the Enhanced Editions, tried to improve the pathfinding system for creatures. This was considered a bad idea. This mods reverts the game to using the pathfinding system from before.
//Use the v2.5 version of the mod if you only can play v2.5 of the games, ie: if you play in Mac.

//////INTERFACE
//UI editing for these games can be finicky. Make one single small change and another mod might render it unusable. For that reason they go at the begining.
//In particular, UI mods should always go before: Deities of Faerun, Tome And Blood, Faiths and Powers, Might and Guile, Shadow Magic, Sword Coast Stratagems, Talents of Faerun, and Reveal Hidden Gameplay Options (though other mods can also do their own changes)
//some small mods like SubtleD's improved identify straight up also won't work with any UI mods, irrespective of install order

// https://github.com/OlvynChuru/OlvynSpells
//WARNING: This mod has a big problem. It's new spells require EEex, for which it installs large lua libraries. The tweaks don't need them and can't use them, but the mod still installs those libraries even if you only want the Bless tweak. This can cause immense lag and slowdowns quickly once a game starts.
////Except for the spell progression tweaks, I will ignore most other tweaks as they are already done by other mods (ie ZSTweaks or SubtleD's Spell Tweaks) without less hassle, and the new spells. If you want to use any of them, you're on your own, they gave me enough headaches.
//What you're going to do is go to your mod repository, open MESpells.tp2 with your text editor (again I rec notepad++)
//Then disable/comment lines 14 (COPY ~MESpells/lua~ ~override~), and lines 66 to 146, just the way these very lines are commented. This way the EEex functions won't be installed. Unless you want the new spells, but that's a problem I won't get into.
//If you don't do any of this and don't want the new spells, then don't even bother using this mod.

//////SPELL MODS
//Mods that add or change spells

////Systematic Spell mods
//Most of these mods influence the magic game, except Thrown Hammers and Trials of Luremaster (which want to go around SR and IWD spells)
//Each tries to tackle spell balance in different ways. SR rebalances vanilla spells, and Spell-50 implements high level scaling them. IWDification fills lacking niches by adding spells and class mechanics from IWD. MiH SP can add the IWD spells like IWDification does, plus add pnp spells and its own modifications.
//For the most part the biggest conflicts will come from SR. Both SR's rebalance and the IWD spells solve the same problems (although they complement each other for some spells), and MiH takes a diametrically opposite approach to SR's. You can always have IWDification, but between SR and MiH SP, choose only one.
//If you install IWDification and MiH SP, let IWDification install the IWD spells.

It should probably also go before Faiths & Powers so its sphere detects the new spells. And it has a few class tweaks, so oh well.

//Artisan's Kitpack
// https://artisans-corner.com/the-artisans-kitpack/
//some of the overhauls tread on the same ideas as ToF's revised kits, skip AK components or disable ToF's on its .ini
//Re Enable classes components: "there’s no technical difference [with other alternatives] but there is a reason it’s needed."
//"Because it’s a good rule to put tweak mods after everything else, what usually happens is people will put kits before TA. The problem with that is what ends up happening when people get to TA is that when they try to unlock classes and kits, a lot of the kits that are now supposed to be available to all races are still restricted by the original class restrictions. Which is why I needed to add the same tweak but in a position where players will be certain to install it before my kits."
//"So basically what would happen is you might try to install, say, the Dark Hunter. You haven't unlocked classes, so the mod sees "ah, halflings can't become rangers" and then it won't actually add it to the halfling's accessible kits. So even if you unlock classes later, you still can't make a halfling dark hunter even though you can make a halfling ranger."

//This kit patches Project Image to avoid a rare bug with "Freedom of Spirit to trigger (Project Image) [...] it can happen only if you dual a high level Sword Angel to mage".

//Will to Power
// https://github.com/UnearthedArcana/Will_to_Power
//SD: "That’s not stutter, that’s because using a psionic power casts like, 1,000 subspells. So it’s just the engine bogging down for a split second. In my experience on a relative potato (A14 chip, 4GB ram) it lags the first time I use a power in each play session, and then it loads the subspells into memory or something? And is buttery smooth for the rest of that session. But then lags again, once, the next time I play. I guess that might be platform-specific, so I am very curious to hear other players’ experiences."

////Weapon proficiency/styles mods - Pre ToF
//All this will be installed here for compatibility with ToF (as it adapts its proficiency modifications to previous changes), except if you plan to also use Skills & Abilities' proficiency revision, then you want to install them after SCS. Technically, DavidW said they should go before ToF, no details. But ToF's UI proficiency trickery seems to start with the new multi/dual combinations, and there are other things that want to go before proficiency overhauls.
//DavidW: "It depends what you want it to do, but the short answer is: install whatever changes you want (manual or otherwise) before ToF. ToF will then try to install around what you choose - but this is fairly experimental compatibility so do it at your own risk (even more so than on a beta mod in general!) I tested this with the proficiency changes in Tweaks Anthology and it seems to work okay, but more radical things will probably cause trouble. I'll have a look at Skills and Abilities when I have the chance (though this sort of compatibility issue is low priority compared to bugfixing). Installing proficiency changes after ToF will do nothing (if you're lucky) or break the game (if you're not)."

////Stratagems of Mystra (spell tweaks and new spells)
//This is actually a subgroup of components inclided in both Talents of Faerun and Sword Coast Stratagems, with some overlap with IWDification. We're installing it here, in particular ToF's version of the components, but a block with SCS' will repeat just below in case you don't use ToF. IWDification includes already the IWD spells and songs, which this install order install them with for better compatibility with other mods that can't or shouldn't go down this far.

//Note: If you want to use ZSTweaks' "Make single-target healing spells other than Heal worth using" instead of the enhanced Cure/Cause spells in these tweaks, you must go to the dw_talents.ini or stratagems.ini (depending the mod you're installing them with) and set enhance_cure_cause to 0.

////Talents of Faerun
// https://github.com/Gibberlings3/TalentsOfFaerun
//It changes so many things, it requires to go after all other kit and spell mods, except one exception.
//We'll split the install in two. First we'll do the "simple" tweaks and additions. It also includes its own cleric overhaul.
//WARNING: Still in beta. Don't install it for actual gameplay unless you want to help test. Being installed in isolation (in respect to other kit mods) is also recommended.

//Talents of Faerun - Races And Class Kits Revisions Part 1
// dw_talents:20000;dw_talents - Introduce new races and subraces
// dw_talents:40000;dw_talents - Eliminate class/race restrictions and most class/ability score restrictions
//Overlaps with TA's dual/multi class restriction components and others (but not AK's)
dw_talents:40100;dw_talents - Revised class alignment rules
//Makes other class alignment mods redundant (ie: TA's 3E druids)
// dw_talents:40150;dw_talents - Make Barbarian Into a Class
//Don't mix with TA's "Expanded Dual-class options", as both do the same for barbarians
// dw_talents:40160;dw_talents - Make Wizard Slayer Kit Available to Barbarians
// dw_talents:40190;dw_talents - Revised Paladins and Blackguards
//Already includes the following components (IWD-style paladins, Revised Smite, additional uses of Lay on Hands and Smite)
//SPLSTATE.IDS entries: 1
// dw_talents:40300;dw_talents - Revised Smite Evil
// dw_talents:40310;dw_talents - Higher-level paladins get additional uses of Lay on Hands and Smite Evil
//all four above essentially the same as MiH SP's and S&A's paladin revisions
dw_talents:40460;dw_talents - Modified thief Evasion
// dw_talents:40470;dw_talents - Rebalanced thief and bounty hunter traps at low levels
//clashes with Epic Thieving's Trap Setting due to different method of reworking trap setting
// dw_talents:40500;dw_talents - Revised favored enemy for rangers: new enemy groups, and rangers reselect their favored enemy at 4th level and every third level thereafter
//Don't mix with HT's

//D2 Workshop Kitpack
// https://github.com/D2-mods/The-Workshop-Kitpack
//D2WK should generally go after class overhauls and modifications to the Evasion skill. Open the config.ini file for extra configuration.
//Install after: IWDification, Rogue Rebalancing, Shohy's bard song mod, A77's Improved Archer, Bardic Wonders, Artisan's Kitpack, Deities of Faerun, Faiths and Powers, Talents of Faerun, Bubb's Spell Menu (configuration possible).
//Install before: proficiency overhauls, SD's 5E Spellcasting, OlvynSpells's metamagic
//ToF compatibility: D2WK should go after the Evasion modifications, and before the priest and sphere components.
//D2WK's abilities can benefit from ToF's Evasion revision if installed after it, but can be a messy install order
//Dan_P: "if you don't care about a few abilities from this mod allowing evasion checks, then it makes no difference installed before or after this mod. If you do want abilities to have Evasion checks, then I'd personally just use IWDification's version (that mod goes earlier in the order than kits). That way, you don't have to split up the ToF install."
//Our easiest option to install D2WK and ToF (at least with PI) is to place it here between the thief and cleric components
//Please note: these component lines are repeated above for F&P/DoF, make sure you aren't installing things twice, or you'll done goofed
//v The Workshop Kitpack
// D2_WORKSHOP_KITS;The Workshop Kitpack - Base kits + multiclass variants
D2_WORKSHOP_NOVARIANTS;The Workshop Kitpack - Base kits only
// D2_WORKSHOP_NOKITS;The Workshop Kitpack - Misc items only (no kits or Hunter Badges)
D2_WORKSHOP_ITEMS;The Workshop Kitpack - Misc item pack
// D2_WORKSHOP_5ECASTING;The Workshop Kitpack - Install if using subtledoctor's 5e casting mod
//Doesn't need to go after 5E casting
// D2_WORKSHOP_MEDICARTSPATCH;The Workshop Kitpack - Update description for Medic Arts (use if Poison Weapon or Lay On Hands were revised after this mod was installed)
//Should probably go after ToF, Nostalgia Pack and Tweaks Anthology at the very least. We'll be installing it after SCS.

//Talents of Faerun - Races And Class Kits Revisions Part 2
//Note: the sphere system includes Armor of Faith in the Divine sphere. Rangers and druids aren't allowed that sphere, and you may feel the lack of AoF on those classes at higher levels.
//To work around it, go to the dw_talents\sphere folder, take ARMOR_OF_FAITH off Divine.txt, and copypaste it into All.txt
// dw_talents:40600;dw_talents - Revised shapeshift powers for druids and avengers
dw_talents:40610;dw_talents - Druids use cleric XP and spell tables
//Overlaps with TA's Alter Druid Spell and Level Progression Tables. This adapts to previous changes to cleric, TA's has different options.

// dw_talents:40700;dw_talents - Allow monks to use staffs
//v Adjust opposition schools for specialty mages
//Avoid mixing with SD's Spell Tweaks's Revised Opposition schools. May cause problems for D2 Workshop Kitpack's Blood Minister.

// dw_talents:40900;dw_talents - Allow multiclassed and dual-classed mages to become specialists and wild mages
// dw_talents:40925;dw_talents - Bloodlines for sorcerers
//Incompatible with T&B's different Sorcerer: [X] Disciple
// dw_talents:40950;dw_talents - Dragon Disciples can be disciples of any chromatic dragon (Red/Blue/Green/Black/White)
//Incompatible with AK's Dragon Disciple
//v Rebalanced and revised kits
//You can disable individual kits in the dw_talents.ini if you want to mix with overhauls from other mods
//AK and BW: this component is redundant with the whole of both those mods except for the totemic druid revision. If doing a ToF focused install, skip AK and BW and use ToF's own revisions instead.
//The rages from TA's NWN-ish Rage, AK's barbarian overhaul and ToF's revision are all different, don't mix.
//Luke's rage last to 7 round + CON modifier. Improves with fear and deaf effects
//AK's rage lasts only 5 rounds and fatigues, but protects and restores drained levels. Leveling up improves bonuses and reduces/removes penalties.
//ToF's rage is same as AK without fatigue and draining protection/restoration. Leveling up adds status immunities. Also related components for special HLAs and make barbarian a class with its own kits.
// dw_talents:41000;dw_talents - Default (affects all kits)

//v Wider access to Grand Mastery
//All three choices have pros and cons. Multi fighters option keeps GM a fighter only advantage, but might feel like fighters taking the Scattergories home.
//Single and multi warriors might feel like it dilutes the fighter advantage, but helps giving all warriors some offense.

//These are to forbid people from abusing dualing into mage or rogue then getting GM. I only want my duals to get mastery at most so eh
// dw_talents:81100;dw_talents - Revised Weapon Proficiency System
//Tl:DR: install after other proficiency mods (IE: TA's), with exceptions handling themselves
//DavidW:
//"To explain what's going on with proficiencies and subraces: setting a subrace in the character-generation system requires some method of transmitting a player choice from chargen to the actual character. I do it via a hidden proficiency: the value that proficiency is set to determines your subrace (the details of which are then enforced via CLAB file)."
//"That means I have to remove the max number of proficiencies at first level as well as adding enough extra proficiency slots that the subrace proficiency can be set. The UI hides all this and enforces the max number itself."
//"If you want to customize profs and/or profsmax, there are three options."
//"1) do it before you install ToF. I don't hardcode anything here, the numbers are pulled from profs and profsmax at install time."
//"2) handedit the appropriate files. For profs.2da, you can edit the actual file if you're careful. Just increase or decrease the amounts by the amount you'd like them to change by. For profsmax.2da, you need to edit m_dw_epd.lua. There is a lua table called dwProfMaxByClass which contains the 1st-level max proficiency levels (from which the higher-level ones can be inferred)."
//"OK, (2) above is wrong. The 'you can't spend more than 2 prof slots at 1st level is currently hardcoded into ToF's UI edits. (I think I was feeling lazy). If there is demand for being able to put >2 pips into a prof at 1st level I can certainly revisit this.  You can edit the actual number of slots you get at 1st level by editing m_dw_epd.lua"
//"(3) If you're comfortable with WEIDU, add a component to ToF that just has the line 'LAF externalize_profsmax END. That takes the 'real' profs.2da table (which you can find in weidu_external/data/dw_shared) and reads it into the LUA. So you can edit profs.2da there and then run the function."
//Bug: proficiency menu unresponsive after dualing. Fixed?
// dw_talents:81200;dw_talents - Revised Weapon Styles
//very similar bonuses to those in Artisan's HT'ss weapon styles component (except for the "prolong for 5 pips that not all classes can reach to make it more rewarding). Sadly it doesn't do much for shield style
//other styles mods are prrrrrobably not very compatible with ToF anyway
// dw_talents:90000;dw_talents - Tidy up class-selection menu
//Not needed unless adding many ToF kits, potentially causing kits not accesing proficiencies they should
// dw_talents:90100;dw_talents - Thieves gain skill points in multiples of five

//Holy number of tweaks, Batman.
//Adviced to be installed as the first tweak mod. Details are a bit more complicated.
//RoyalProtector on compatibility with Talents of Faerun:
//"One soft incompatibility that has been noted is that ToF's multiclass kits don't seem to play well on a technical level with tweaks to items that add a bonus to single-classed characters, since it seems that those multiclassed varieties are, under the hood, actually just a single-class kit, and that fact is concealed through UI edits. For example, if an item is supposed to benefit single-classed Thieves, ToF's Fighter/Assassin might benefit too, even if it wasn't intended and as a result it becomes unbalanced in some way. I'm not 100% sure of this, but according to some reports, that seems to be the case."
//In short: ZSTweaks gives to items bonuses intended for pure classes, but the way ToF's kit works means multiclass kits will benefit from those anyway. I'd recommend respecting ZSTweaks' intended behaviors.

//ZSTweaks - General Item & Spell Tweaks
//The components changing the basic weapon qualities tread the same ground as Item Revisions, Forgotten Armaments, and some of SubtleD's Item Tweaks and Made in Heaven Item Pack
//Overwriting FA with these should keep FA's added crit threat to weapons without problem in some cases. In others you may want to set a given update_nwn_X value to 0 in forgotten-armament.ini to disable that weapon type for compatibility.
//SubtleD's Item Tweaks' Functional Weapon Tweaks might be compatible if installed after this.

//Note that it gives penalties, but doesn't forbid. Redundant with Item Revisions' "Revised Backstabbing", possibly incompatible with House Tweaks's "Backstab With Any Weapon"?
// ZSTweaks:1121;ZSTweaks - Make Flails and Morningstars always inflict a small amount of piercing damage
//probably fine with FA, as this only seems to add a new effect, not change what's already there
// ZSTweaks:1150;ZSTweaks - Make Spears do a baseline damage of 1d8, not 1d6
//FA and MiH Fixpack already do the same. Probably safe to overwrite. SD's IT give them 1d10.
// ZSTweaks:1160;ZSTweaks - Make Warhammers do a baseline damage 1d5+1, not 1d4+1 (except hammers outside that range)
//FA already brings all hammers to the standard of those "outside that range", that is 1d8.
//MiH Fixpack fixes hammers so that the stronger ones do 2d4+2 instead of 2d4, the same way weaker hammers do 1d4+1, not 1d4.

//if installed after ToF's grandmastery on warriors, every warrior multi is limited to mastery in dw
//Again, better to avoid mixing with ToF, but if you do, ToF slows slow prof point progression, consider something to accelerate it

// D5_REVISED_ABILITY_SCORES;SubtleD's Stat Overhauls - Ability Score Overhaul
//Incompatible with ToF's Revised ability score modifiers, House Tweaks also changes CON, MiH Tweaks STR DEX and CON, TBTweaks all but WIS.
//Bonus increases are irregular for each stat.
//25 STR +4 thac0 +9 damage

//25 INT +6 spell save (warriors +1 extra prof +1 per 9/7/5 levels at lv 13/15/17)
//25 WIS +5 death save +6 poly save
//25 CHA +5 breath and wand save, +1/2 luck at lv18/23, +2% xp bonus every level starting lv14
// D5_ABILITY_SCORE_SPELL_SLOTS;SubtleD's Stat Overhauls - Stat-based Bonus Spell Slots
//Incompatible with ToF's Revised ability score modifiers and House Tweak's INT/WIS/CHA-based Bonus Spell Slots.
// D5_SBO_5E_MEM_PLUS_CASTING_SLOTS;SubtleD's Stat Overhauls - bonuses for memorization slots AND casting slots
// D5_SBO_5E_CASTING_SLOTS_ONLY_;SubtleD's Stat Overhauls - bonuses only for casting slots
//Intended for SD's 5E Spellcasting. Take one of these two, OR the ones from 5E, don't go mixing bonuses. Readme for more info. 
// D5_1_HAND_STR_PENALTY;SubtleD's Stat Overhauls - Full Strength for 2-Hand Weapons Only
//I like the idea, but I don't like how the STR penalty affects more than the weapon damage.
// D5_REVISED_HD;SubtleD's Stat Overhauls - Generous (above-average) hit points
// D5_HARDCORE_HD;SubtleD's Stat Overhauls - Closer to average hit points
// D5_REDUCED_HD;SubtleD's Stat Overhauls - Reduced hit points
//One of these three, don't mix with other hit point mods like TA's.

//Incompatible with ToF's Revised Ability Scores.
// D5_REVISED_DUAL_CLASS_REQS;SubtleD's Stat Overhauls - Lower Dual-Class Requirements
//Overlaps with ToF's "Eliminate class/race restrictions and most class/ability score restrictions".
// D5_UNIFORM_XP_TABLES;SubtleD's Stat Overhauls - Slower, standardized XP Tables
//Make sure this is a leveling speed progression you want. Also does the same as some mods that match the druid spellcasting table with the priest one.
// D5_EIGHTH_CREATURE_XP;SubtleD's Stat Overhauls - kills give 1/8th XP
// D5_QUARTER_CREATURE_XP;SubtleD's Stat Overhauls - kills give 1/4th XP
// D5_HALF_CREATURE_XP;SubtleD's Stat Overhauls - kills give half XP
//Take one of the three. Note, the less xp the harder the game becomes.
// D5_REVISED_MR;SubtleD's Stat Overhauls - Replace Magic Resistance with Other Effects
// D5_REDUCED_MR;SubtleD's Stat Overhauls - Reduce Magic Resistance

//EET Tweaks - XP adjustments 2
//Use these judiciously depending on how many mods rewarding xp (ie: quests and some NPCs) you install. Or crank up of the difficulty.
//v XP for Traps, Spells and Lockpicking
//Vanilla friendly progressive (and maybe the others) is ignoring the added columns 41 to 50 from TA's xp cap removal, and that somehow screws with ToF.
//Install at the end until an update somewhen fixes it, then return to below xp cap removal.
//Choose this or Selphira Tweaks'. Selphira Tweaks' is less jumpy than EET Tweaks' Vanilla friendly progressive. Can coexist with MiH Spell Pack's Revised Spell Learning XP.

mih_sp:17;Made in Heaven: Spell Pack - Revised Spell Learning XP
//Seems a more sane progression than EETTweaks', and must be installed after. Can overwrite Selphira Tweaks'

//Subtledoctor's NPC EE
// https://github.com/UnearthedArcana/NPC_EE
//don't mix with SCS/ToF's Improved NPC customisation and management. Pick one or the other
//IWD1: Not quite as needed, as vanilla doesn't have party NPCs, and most modded ones start at very low levels, so you only use this to change their class.
// D5_OTHER_NPCS_NOT_DUAL;NPC_EE - Remove dual-class flag from all other NPCs (warning, see Readme)
//only useful when installing a NPC mod with dual class that you'll want to relevel

//AutoDescription
// https://github.com/Selphira/AutoDescription
//Goes after EEex and anything adding and/or modifying items and spells
//Warning for potatoes! This started to use 10GB of my 4GB of RAM. Yeah, I had -6GBs than what it wants. Mindboggling.
