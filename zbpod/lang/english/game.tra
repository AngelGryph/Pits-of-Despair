@10000 = ~Angelfist +5~
@10001 = ~Created in the celestial forges of Elysium, Angelfist is a warhammer imbued with divine purpose. Its head is radiant silver, glowing with a soft, ethereal light that illuminates the darkest corners of the material plane. Angelic decorations and symbols adorn it, blessed by the heavens themselves. It feels warm and comforting to the touch.

When wielded, Angelfist feels alive, throbbing with the fire of righteousness and justice. Each swing resonates with a heavenly chorus that intensifies when using its Heavenly Hammer ability. Upon striking a foe, it delivers not only physical might but also a searing burst of radiant energy. Enemies struck by Angelfist find themselves momentarily blinded, as if caught in the gaze of the divine.

How this weapon fell into the hands of the Winged, none know or have the courage to ask, as even gazing upon it may draw her ire. However, it is rumored to be her only comfort, the reason she can endure the presence of mortals.

@10061 = ~This crossbow is a sleek, silvered weapon adorned with faintly glowing etchings of celestial constellations. When bolts are loaded into it, they seem to shimmer and vanish, only to reappear in the bowstring, ready to be fired. The weapon is light and easy to handle, and the wielder feels a sense of calm and focus when using it.

@10091 = ~These gloves were given to Nephetel when she was first inducted into the Thieves Guild. While they were supposedly not magical, it seems that her deeds have over time imbued them with a certain power, which reflect the owner's skills. These gloves fit snugly around her hands, and are made of a soft, supple leather that is surprisingly durable. They are unadorned, save for a small, stylized 'N' on the back of each hand. They are well-worn, but have been meticulously cared for, and show no signs of wear. Because of this adaptation to her, only she may wear them.

@10110 = ~Rod of Illusive Protections~
@10111 = ~This rod is a slender, tacky, and heavily adorned length of polished wood, capped with a fairly big and multi-colored gemstone. It is said to have been created by a rich illusionist, who was only known by the people around them as "The Illusive Man".

In the end, The Illusive Man was betrayed by his own illusions, and the rod was lost to time.

@10112 = ~Vyatri's Note~ //quest
@10113 = ~The Pits of Despair: Desperate and True by Baeloth Barrityl Dictated but not read~
@10114 = ~Reviewed by Altharion Veldrith, Scholar of the Arcane and Occasional Tavern Critic

Baeloth Barrityl, the notorious drow socerer and self-proclaimed "Entertainer" has once again unleashed his literary prowess upon the unsuspecting masses. His latest work, The Pits of Despair: Desperate and True, is a rousing mix of drama, despair, and – as one might expect – a rather excessive amount of self-aggrandizement.

However, there are moments in which Barrityl’s over-the-top style gets the best of him. The prose often veers into the theatrical—though, given that this is a work by a drow socerer, this is perhaps to be expected. The narrative is occasionally interrupted by lengthy monologues that read as though they were lifted directly from one of Barrityl's own performances, making it unclear whether the book is a story or simply a vehicle for Barrityl’s self-promotion. One could imagine him standing on a stage, flourishing dramatically as he dictates each word with an exaggerated flourish. If you enjoy the sound of your own voice (or, in this case, the written word) more than the development of characters and plot, this might suit your taste.

In conclusion, The Pits of Despair: Desperate and True is a book that will divide its audience. Some will find it a masterpiece of bleak, brooding storytelling—an ode to the complexities of the soul and the burdens of heroism. Others will be turned off by its heavy-handed melodrama and self-indulgent prose. Still, as a work dictated by Baeloth Barrityl himself, it is undeniably fascinating and worthy of attention, if only for its sheer audacity and bravado. Whether or not you emerge from the pits of despair with any sense of hope is a matter for each reader to decide.

Rating: ★★★☆☆ (3/5 stars)
A work of considerable ambition, but ultimately, one that may leave you feeling more exhausted than enlightened.~
