@0    = ~It looks like I have a letter and a fancy box for you good <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@1    = ~I do accept gold or fancy boxes as a delivery fee.~
@2    = ~Thank you. Here is a gold piece, don't spend it all in one place.~
@3    = ~Didn't Vytari pay you to bring me this parcel? This must be a Shadow Thief racket, fees for everything.~
@4    = ~Get out of my sight. You were paid to deliver and you have.~
@5    = ~Thank you, this'll feed my twelve sick children and dying grandmother just fine.~
@6    = ~Fast and reliable only gets you so far in this business, I'm sure such a dignified <PRO_LADYLORD> can spare a few coins for quality service.~
@7    = ~Fine. Here is 1 gold.~
@8    = ~You're right, take 5 gold for your time.~
@9    = ~Don't test me urchin. Your usefulness is over, leave.~
@10   = ~I suppose the high and mighty hero can't be bothered to spare a single pitiful coin.~
@11   = ~Well look here, a mighty Bhaalspawn. They say that you are one of a kind, more than your brothers and sisters in Murder.~
@12   = ~Hello, who might you be?~
@13   = ~You've heard true, what is your name?~
@14   = ~My name is Nephetel. Perhaps you would allow me to give you a word of advice?~
@15   = ~Of course my lady.~
@16   = ~Whatcha got?~
@17   = ~I've no need for advice from a stranger. I keep my own counsel.~
@18   = ~Before you begin in the arena you should consider fighting in the Creature Features. They'll give you aâ€¦  taste for the real matches, see Stirv in the kennel to get started.~
@19   = ~Watch out for that crazy bastard Stirv. He is a sadist. His 'puppies' love him and he performs all kinds of experiments on them using concoctions, mutations, and devilish training techniques. He has even been able to get them to fight as a team without ripping each other apart. If there are great evils like the Pits of Despair, then there are lesser evils that hide within them and Stirv is one. He will laugh and delight in watching his pets eat you alive.~
@20   = ~A cold response but understandable. You should still heed my word and consider fighting in the Creature Features in the kennel. There is something to put your fangs into there.~
@21   = ~Hero of Baldur's Gate, eh? The star in the night sky as far as Dennaton is concerned. What can I do for you?~
@22   = ~Who are you?~
@23   = ~How did you come to this place?~
@24   = ~Would you be interested in helping me escape this place?~
@25   = ~You look familiar. There was this messenger who got me into this mess and your voice sounds suspiciously similar.~
@26   = ~You stood next to Dennaton during the feast. Are you two close?~
@27   = ~I'll let you get back to whatever you were doing.~
@28   = ~Me? My name is Nephetel, nice to meet you.~
@29   = ~I got trapped in a spider's web and found myself here, just like you.~
@30   = ~Between the two of us you are not the only one with a bone to pick with Dennaton. It is unwise to discuss it now openly, yes? Get familiar with what we're dealing with and learn the lay of the land and we'll talk again soon.~
@31   = ~Being suspicious is fine, but rude as well? A woman is a cavalcade of mystery and I'm no exception.~
@32   = ~Why would we be? I always like to stay close to those who might need a nudge with my dagger.~
@33   = ~Anything else I can clear up for you?~
