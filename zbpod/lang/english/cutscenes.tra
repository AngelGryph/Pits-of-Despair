@1= ~Pits of Despair

A messenger delivered a note from Vyatri, an innkeeper in Tradesmeet, who requested that we visit his establishment. A ring was enclosed with the letter, along with promises of further rewards, if we meet a Djinni there.~
@2 = ~It has been several months since you defeated Sarevok in Baldur's Gate. Tales of your deeds, and whispers of your dark heritage, have spread far and wide, Even bards sing of them wherever you travel ...~
@3 = ~Along the Sword Coast they travelled with stealth, wits and brawn.~
@4 = ~Investigating matters of iron, wayward bandits and then learnt they are a Bhaalspawn.~
@5 = ~The final battle: a city, breath held, nearing a most unwelcome fate.~
@6 = ~But they rose to the challenge, ending the crisis, and became the Heroes of Baldur's Gate.~
/* above line changes end here */
@7 = ~A decent yarn, though a bit TOO fantastic if you ask me.~
@8 = ~Thank you. It is an amazing tale, all the more so for the fact that it actually happened.~
@9 = ~You are a talented entertainer, madam, but do not insult my intelligence. The story you told is naught but a story. It never happened.~

/* 1st Cutscene Infamy */
@10 = ~And? What of the book?~
@11 = ~Nothing. The hero-apparent from Baldur's Gate is the only gossip on anyone's lips. The nobles can't seem to make up their mind on whether this hero is a savior or a terror. Unusual… for a Bhaalspawn.~
@12 = ~~
@13 = ~~
@14 = ~Don't play games with me, Nephetel. Speak plainly.~
@15 = ~Apologies, Spymaster. It is said that they are a child of the Lord of Murder, though I know not the truth to these tales.~
@16 = ~This… Child of Bhaal, if that is indeed what they are… how might they compare to our pet in the arena?~
@17 = ~This Bhaalspawn is different from… from him. They seem entirely detached from the cult's influence..~
@18 = ~Your main concern is the book. Find it, and our master will most assuredly be pleased. I'll expect a full report on this… godchild when next we meet.~
@24 = ~Of course, Spymaster.~
/* End of 1st Cutscene Infamy */
@25 = ~Your head spins suddenly...~

@100 = ~Why are these idiots fighting? *sigh*~
@101 = ~Now just let me fit your ring in this … well maybe this way? Ah, that's it. Ala-khazoom. Hold on everyone!~
