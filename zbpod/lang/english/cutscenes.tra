@1= ~Pits of Despair

A messenger delivered a note from Vyatri, an innkeeper in Tradesmeet, who requested that we visit his establishment. A ring was enclosed with the letter, along with promises of further rewards, if we meet a Djinni there.~
@2 = ~Along the Sword Coast they traveled, battling all kinds of horrible creatures. Investigating matters of tainted iron and politics, only to discover their own Bhaalspawn blood behind it.~
@3 = ~It sounds fantastic, I know, but it IS true. I can prove it unless I'm much mistaken, the hero of Baldur's Gate is among us this very minute. Everyone, say hello to <CHARNAME> our tale's protagonist in the flesh!~
@4 = ~Investigating matters of iron, wayward bandits and then learnt they are a Bhaalspawn.~
@5 = ~The final battle: a city, breath held, nearing a most unwelcome fate.~
@6 = ~But they rose to the challenge, ending the crisis, and became the Heroes of Baldur's Gate.~
/* above line changes end here */
@7 = ~A decent yarn, though a bit TOO fantastic if you ask me.~
@8 = ~Thank you. It is an amazing tale, all the more so for the fact that it actually happened.~
@9 = ~You are a talented entertainer, madam, but do not insult my intelligence. The story you told is naught but a story. It never happened.~

/* 1st Cutscene Infamy */
@10 = ~And? What of the book?~
@11 = ~Nothing. The hero-apparent from Baldur's Gate is the only gossip on anyone's lips. The nobles can't seem to make up their mind on whether this hero is a savior or a terror. Unusual… for a Bhaalspawn.~
@12 = ~~
@13 = ~~
@14 = ~Don't play games with me, Nephetel. Speak plainly.~
@15 = ~Apologies, Spymaster. It is said that they are a child of the Lord of Murder, though I know not the truth to these tales.~
@16 = ~This… Child of Bhaal, if that is indeed what they are… how might they compare to our pet in the arena?~
@17 = ~This Bhaalspawn is different from… from him. They seem entirely detached from the cult's influence..~
@18 = ~Your main concern is the book. Find it, and our master will most assuredly be pleased. I'll expect a full report on this… godchild when next we meet.~
@24 = ~Of course, Spymaster.~
/* End of 1st Cutscene Infamy */
@25 = ~Your head spins suddenly...~
// zbbcut00
@35 = ~Baldur’s Gate held its breath as a battle of godly heritage unraveled beneath the ground. But they rose to the challenge, ending the crisis, and became heroes to the city.~

// zbcut02
@50 = ~What the hells?!~
@51 = ~Run for it!~

@100 = ~Surely there are more productive things these idiots could be doing…~
@101 = ~Now just let me fit this ring on your finger gah… well maybe this way? Ah, that's it. Hold on to your belongings… off to Amn we go! Ala-khazoom!~
